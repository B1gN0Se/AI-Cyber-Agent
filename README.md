# AI-Cyber-Agent

This is an experimental, autonomous AI agent designed for cybersecurity tasks. It leverages the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like DeepSeek via the **OpenRouter API** to automate penetration testing workflows. The agent operates directly on your command line, making decisions and executing tools to achieve a given objective.

## How It Works:

It operates on a simple yet powerful **Think → Act → Observe** loop:

**Think:** Given a target and an objective, the agent sends its current status and history to the model. The LLM analyzes the situation and decides on the next logical step, formulating its reasoning and the precise command to execute.  

**Act:** The agent executes the command generated by the LLM directly in your local terminal with sudo privileges. This allows it to use any installed tool and even install new ones if needed. 

**Observe:** The agent captures the full output of the command and sends it back to the LLM as context for the next "Think" cycle. This allows the agent to learn from its actions, handle errors, and chain commands together intelligently.

## STEPS TO RUN - Always run this tool in Kali Linux VM for best results:

```sh
python3 -m venv pentest_framework
```

```sh
source pentest_framework/bin/activate
```

```sh
pip install requests
```

```sh
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```
```sh
python3 AI_AGENT.py --target "example.com" --objective "Identify and exploit any reflected XSS"
```
